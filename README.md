# Gelly Introduction Work Repository

This is the Gelly Task from TU Berlin, which include the following contents:

1. Create the project in Maven with `flink-gelly` dependency

2. Create the basic gelly graph in `APP.java`

3. Implement a basic BFS search in `BFS.java`

4. Enable both bi-direction and single-direction BFS by specify the BD argument when instantiate the BFS


        //set false to disable bi-direction BFS, otherwise use true
        BFS walker = BFS.getInstance(false);


One issue is still here which is extend Graph.java to Graphr class,
extend a class with private constructor is little bit tricky for me.

Hope this repository make sense.
